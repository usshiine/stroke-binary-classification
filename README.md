# stroke-binary-classification
This project aims to predict whether a person has a stroke or not with Multilayer Perceptron using Tensorflow Keras Library.

# Instructions for use:
1. Before creating a prediction model, download the dataset first at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/godfatherfigure/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data/data
2. Download or import this repository then modify the file address according to its location.
3. After that, run the model you want to use with the specified dataset file address.
4. Confusion matrix, precision, recall, f1-score and accuracy are some of the final result metrics from the model evaluation process which can later be analyzed according to needs.
